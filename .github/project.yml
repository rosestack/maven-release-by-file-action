# Maven Release Configuration
# This file defines the release and next development versions for the project.
# 
# Workflow:
# 1. Edit this file to set current-version and next-version
# 2. Create a PR with these changes
# 3. After PR is merged to main, the release action will automatically:
#    - Create a release branch with current-version
#    - Build and deploy artifacts to Maven Central
#    - Create a git tag and GitHub release
#    - Deploy documentation to GitHub Pages
#    - Update main branch with next-version
#    - Close current milestone and create next milestone
#
# Version format:
# - current-version: Must NOT contain -SNAPSHOT (e.g., "0.0.1")
# - next-version: Must contain -SNAPSHOT (e.g., "0.0.2-SNAPSHOT")

release:
  # The version to be released (without -SNAPSHOT suffix)
  current-version: 0.0.1
  
  # The next development version (with -SNAPSHOT suffix)
  next-version: 0.0.2-SNAPSHOT
